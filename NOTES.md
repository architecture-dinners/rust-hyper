## Month #1 (max)

### Easy
The package management and build setup were all super straightforward. There's still work to be done to cut down on the final container size, but someone else can take that up if disk space is an issue.

### Hard
As expected, `hyper` requires a lot of boilerplate...so doing simple things is hard. Hopefully this means that it doesn't get in the way when things get more complex down the road.

### Surprising
The `config` crate works really well! I hadn't used it before, and was surprised at how easy it was to set up and use.
